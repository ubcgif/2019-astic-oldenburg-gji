    abstract = { The inversion of electromagnetic sounding data does not yield a unique solution, but inevitably a single model to interpret the observations is sought. We recommend that this model be as simple, or smooth, as possible, in order to reduce the temptation to overinterpret the data and to eliminate arbitrary discontinuities in simple layered models. To obtain smooth models, the nonlinear forward problem is linearized about a starting model in the usual way, but it is then solved explicitly for the desired model rather than for a model correction. By parameterizing the model in terms of its first or second derivative with depth, the minimum norm solution yields the smoothest possible model. Rather than fitting the experimental data as well as possible (which maximizes the roughness of the model), the smoothest model which fits the data to within an expected tolerance is sought. A practical scheme is developed which optimizes the step size at each iteration and retains the computational efficiency of layered models, resulting in a stable and rapidly convergent algorithm. The inversion of both magnetotelluric and Schlumberger sounding field data, and a joint magnetotelluric‐resistivity inversion, demonstrate the method and show it to have practical application. }

@article{Gallardo2011,
abstract = {Multiphysics imaging or data inversion is of growing importance in many branches of science and engineering. In geophysical sciences, there is a need for combining information from multiple images acquired using different imaging devices and/or modalities because of the potential for accurate predictions. The major challenges are how to combine disparate data from unrelated physical phenomena, taking into account the different spatial scales of the measurement devices, model complexities, and how to quantify the associated uncertainties. This review paper summarizes the role played by the structural gradients-based approach for coupling fundamentally different physical fields in (mainly) geophysical inversion, develops further understanding of this approach to guide newcomers to the field, and defines the main challenges and directions for future research that may be useful in other fields of science and engineering.},

abstract={A Bayesian linear inversion methodology based on Gaussian mixture models and its application to geophysical inverse problems are presented in this paper. The proposed inverse method is based on a Bayesian approach under the assumptions of a Gaussian mixture random field for the prior model and a Gaussian linear likelihood function. The model for the latent discrete variable is defined to be a stationary first-order Markov chain. In this approach, a recursive exact solution to an approximation of the posterior distribution of the inverse problem is proposed. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm can be used to efficiently simulate realizations from the correct posterior model. Two inversion studies based on real well log data are presented, and the main results are the posterior distributions of the reservoir properties of interest, the corresponding predictions and prediction intervals, and a set of conditional realizations. The first application is a seismic inversion study for the prediction of lithological facies, P- and S-impedance, where an improvement of 30{\%} in the root-mean-square error of the predictions compared to the traditional Gaussian inversion is obtained. The second application is a rock physics inversion study for the prediction of lithological facies, porosity, and clay volume, where predictions slightly improve compared to the Gaussian inversion approach.},

abstract={We have developed a method for three-dimensional simultaneous velocity and density inversion using traveltimes of local earthquakes and gravity data. The purpose of this method is to constrain the velocity inversion and increase the spatial resolution of shallow velocity structures by introducing additional gravity data. The gravity data contributes to the P- and S-wave velocity models by imposing constraints between seismic velocities and density. The constraint curve is constructed so as to fit the data for porous rock samples, and deviations from the curve are taken into account in the inversion. The constraint is imposed at only the first layer, because density structure is well resolved at shallower parts and it is difficult to determine uniquely at greater depths. Synthetic inversion tests indicate that gravity data can improve the resolution of the velocity models for this layer. The method is applied to investigate the subsurface structure of Izu-Oshima volcano, Japan and velocity structures with high spatial resolution are obtained. The additional gravity data contribute primarily to improvement of the S-wave velocity model. At 0.25 km depth, a high velocity anomaly due to caldera-filling lava flows is observed. At 1.25 and 2.5 km depths, high velocity intrusive bodies are detected. A NW-SE trending high velocity belt at 1.25 km depth is interpreted as being caused by repeated intrusion of dikes.},

  abstract={We develop a methodology to invert two different data sets with the assumption that the underlying models have a common structure. Structure is defined in terms of absolute value of curvature of the model and two models are said to have common structure if the changes occur at the same physical locations. The joint inversion is solved by defining an objective function which quantifies the difference in structure between two models, and then minimizing this objective function subject to satisfying the data constraints. The problem is nonlinear and is solved iteratively using Krylov space techniques. Testing the algorithm on synthetic data sets shows that the joint inversion is superior to individual inversions. In an application to field data we show that the data sets are consistent with models that are quite similar.},

abstract = {To be reliable, Earth models used for mineral exploration should be consistent with all available geological and geophysical information. During the past several years an important focus of inversion research has been towards advancing the integration of geological data (such as lithology and structure), physical property data (measurements taken on rock samples) and geophysical survey data through appropriate inversion methodologies. We expand the types of geological information that can be incorporated into ‘minimum structure' type deterministic inversions involving minimisation of an objective function. These include orientation information and physical property trends. We also present an iterative cooperative inversion strategy for combining multiple types of geophysical data and recovering geologically realistic models involving sharp interfaces between rock units. We provide a synthetic example to illustrate our methods. },

abstract = {We describe an inversion method for 3D geomagnetic data based on approximation of the source distribution by means of positive constrained Gaussian functions. In this way, smoothness and positivity are automatically imposed on the source without any subjective input from the user apart from selecting the number of functions to use. The algorithm has been tested with synthetic data in order to resolve sources at very different depths, using data from one measurement plane only. The forward modeling is based on prismatic cell parameterization, but the algebraic nonuniqueness is reduced because a relationship among the cells, expressed by the Gaussian envelope, is assumed to describe the spatial variation of the source distribution. We assume that there is no remanent magnetization and that the magnetic data are produced by induced magnetization only, neglecting any demagnetization effects. The algorithm proceeds by minimization of a {\^{A}}2 misfit function between real and predicted data using a nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt iteration scheme, easily implemented on a desktop PC, without any additional regularization. We demonstrate the robustness and utility of the method using synthetic data corrupted by pseudorandom generated noise and a real field data set.},

@article{Cockett2015,
abstract = {Inverse modeling is a powerful tool for extracting information about the subsurface from geophysical data. Geophysical inverse problems are inherently multidisciplinary, requiring elements from the relevant physics, numerical simulation, and optimization, as well as knowledge of the geologic setting, and a comprehension of the interplay between all of these elements. The development and advancement of inversion methodologies can be enabled by a framework that supports experimentation, is flexible and extensible, and allows the knowledge generated to be captured and shared. The goal of this paper is to propose a framework that supports many different types of geophysical forward simulations and deterministic inverse problems. Additionally, we provide an open source implementation of this framework in Python called S. imPEG (Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics, http://simpeg.xyz). Included in S. imPEG are staggered grid, mimetic finite volume discretizations on a number of structured and semi-structured meshes, convex optimization programs, inversion routines, model parameterizations, useful utility codes, and interfaces to standard numerical solver packages. The framework and implementation are modular, allowing the user to explore, experiment with, and iterate over a variety of approaches to the inverse problem. S. imPEG provides an extensible, documented, and well-tested framework for inverting many types of geophysical data and thereby helping to answer questions in geoscience applications. Throughout the paper we use a generic direct current resistivity problem to illustrate the framework and functionality of S. imPEG.},

@article{Ju2012,
abstract = {In this paper, in order to improve both the performance and the efficiency of the conventional Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), generalized GMMs are firstly introduced by integrating the conventional GMMs and the active curve axis GMMs for fitting non-linear datasets, and then two types of Fuzzy Gaussian Mixture Models (FGMMs) with a faster convergence process are proposed based on the generalized GMMs, inspired from the mechanism of Fuzzy C-means (FCMs) which introduces the degree of fuzziness on the dissimilarity function based on distances. One is named as probability based FGMMs defining the dissimilarity as the multiplicative inverse of probability density function, and the other is distance based FGMMs which define the dissimilarity function focusing the degree of fuzziness only on the distances between points and component centres. Different from FCMs, both of the proposed dissimilarity functions are based on the exponential function of the distance. The FGMMs are compared with the conventional GMMs and the generalized GMMs in terms of the fitting degree and convergence speed. The experimental results show that the proposed FGMMs not only possess the non-linearity to fit datasets with curve manifolds but also have a much faster convergence process saving more than half computational cost than GMMs. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Grana2010,
abstract = {A joint estimation of petrophysical properties is proposed that combines statistical rock physics and Bayesian seismic inversion. Because elastic attributes are correlated with petrophysical variables (effective porosity, clay content, and water saturation) and this physical link is associated with uncertainties, the petro-physical-properties estimation from seismic data can be seen as a Bayesian inversion problem. The purpose of this work was to develop a strategy for estimating the probability distributions of petrophysical parameters and litho-fluid classes from seismics. Estimation of reservoir properties and the associated uncertainty was performed in three steps: linearized seismic inversion to estimate the probabilities of elastic parameters, probabilistic upscaling to include the scale-changes effect, and petrophysical inversion to estimate the probabilities of petrophysical variables and litho-fluid classes. Rock-physics equations provide the linkbetween reservoir properties and velocities, and linearized seismic modeling connects velocities and density to seismic amplitude. A full Bayesian approach was adopted to propagate uncertainty from seismics to petrophysics in an integrated framework that takes into account different sources of uncertainty: heterogeneity of the real data, approximation of physical models, measurement errors, and scale changes. The method has been tested, as a feasibility step, on real well data and synthetic seismic data to show reliable propagation of the uncertainty through the three different steps and to compare two statistical approaches: parametric and nonparametric. Application to a real reservoir study (including data from two wells and partially stacked seismic volumes) has provided as a main result the probability densities of petrophysical properties and litho-fluid classes. It demonstrated the applicability of the proposed inversion method},

@book{tikhonov1977solutions,
  abstract = {MR: Let F and U be metric spaces. The problem of determining a "solution'' z∈F from the "initial data'' u∈U is said to be wellposed with respect to the pair of spaces (F,U) if for each u∈U there exists a solution z∈F; the solution is unique; and the solution is stable relative to small changes in the initial data. Problems that do not satisfy these requirements are said to be ill-posed.
   The notion of a well-posed mathematical problem made its debut with discussions in Chapter I of J. Hadamard's book [Lectures on Cauchy's problem in linear partial differential equations, Yale Univ. Press, New Haven, Conn., 1923; Jbuch 49, 725]. Hadamard observed: "But it is remarkable, on the other hand, that a sure guide is found in physical interpretation: an analytic problem being well-posed, in our use of the phrase, when it is the translation of some mechanical or physical question.'' For a long time, it was an accepted point of view in the mathematical literature that ill-posed problems cannot describe real phenomena and objects. It is now recognized that this attitude about ill-posed problems is erroneous, and that "the majority of applied problems are, and always have been, ill-posed, particularly when they require numerical answers''.
   A. N. Tihonov [Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR 151 (1963), 501--504; MR0162377 (28 #5576); ibid. 153 (1963), 49--52; MR0162378 (28 #5577)] was one of the earliest workers in the field of ill-posed problems who succeeded in giving a precise mathematical definition of "approximations'' for general classes of such problems, and in constructing "optimal'' solutions. This monograph is a survey of the main thrust of contributions by Soviet mathematicians to ill-posed problems, with emphasis on extensions and elaborations of ideas which were originated by Tihonov and his school.
   The authors give many examples from analysis, physics, and engineering that lead to ill-posed problems, for example, the Cauchy problem for the Laplace equation, integral equations of the first kind, the problem of differentiation of a function that is known only approximately, summation of Fourier series with approximate coefficients, analytic continuation of functions, design of optimal control systems, automatic processing of observational data, inverse problems in geophysics, synthesis problems, etc. Many of these problems can be formulated in the form (∗) Az=u, where A is a completely continuous operator from F to U. If the initial data in such problems are known only approximately and contain a random error, then the instability of their solutions leads to nonuniqueness of the classically-derived approximate solutions and to serious difficulties in their physical interpretation. Also, in many cases there simply is no classical solution of problems with approximate initial data. In Chapter 1, the authors define a concept of an approximate solution that is stable to small changes in the initial data, and use a selection method for deriving this solution. This is based on additional information that restricts the set of all possible solutions to a compact set M. The authors also discuss quasi-solutions of (∗), i.e., zˆ∈M minimizing the functional d(Az,u) over M, where d is a metric.
   One feature (indeed the central theme) of this book is the development (in Chapter II) of the regularization method in the construction of approximate solutions of ill-posed problems that was first expounded by Tihonov [op. cit.], when the set of all possible solutions is not necessarily compact. An operator R(u,α) depending on a parameter α is called a regularizing operator for the equation (∗) if (i) R(u,α) is defined for every α>0, u∈U and is continuous in u; (ii) if Az˜=u˜, then there is α(δ) such that, for any ε>0, there is δ(ε) for which the condition d(uδ,u˜)≤δ(ε) implies that d(z˜,zδ)≤ε, where zδ=R(uδ,α), and α=α(δ). The usefulness of this notion resides in the fact that if d(u˜,uδ)≤δ, then one can take for an approximate solution of (∗) with approximately known data uδ the element zα=R(uδ,α) obtained with the aid of the regularization operator. Several methods are developed for the choice of the regularization parameter α and for the construction of regularization operators by variational methods.
   Chapter III is a brief exposition on the solution of singular and ill-conditioned systems of linear algebraic equations by the regularization method. Approximate regularized solutions of integral equations of the first kind of convolution type are discussed in Chapter IV. In Chapter V the authors develop certain optimal regularizing operators for integral operators for integral equations of the convolution type, and discuss for this case the connection between the regularization method and optimal Wiener filtering. Regularization methods are used in Chapter VI to provide stable methods of summing Fourier series with coefficients that are approximate in the l2 metric. Stable methods of minimizing functionals and solving optimal control problems, and of solving ill-posed optimal planning (linear programming) problems, are treated in Chapters VII and VIII, respectively.
   The initial data underlying ill-posed problems (generally measurements) contain random errors. Depending on the nature of this initial information, one can take either a deterministic or a probabilistic approach to the approximate solutions. The authors have generally (except for parts of Chapters IV and V) confined themselves to the deterministic approach. The authors "have not attempted a survey of the literature on ill-posed problems. Therefore, the bibliography does not pretend to be complete''. The bibliography contains 221 references, of which nearly 190 are by Soviet authors; the remaining references for the most part are not cited explicitly in the exposition.
   In the Translation Editor's Preface, he concludes: "The present translation should be of special interest to mathematicians and scientists concerned with the numerical solution of applied problems.... But not just to those. Past experience suggests that the concepts and methods used in the discussion of ill-posed problems will in turn stimulate advances in `pure' mathematical analysis.'' For the latter purpose this book provides stimulating concepts and methods that have no nontrivial counterpart in mathematical analysis of well-posed problems. As far as methods of constructing solutions that are easily processed on a computer, this monograph represents the history, and not the future of numerical analysis of ill-posed problems (it does not survey recent advances in other methods, e.g., iterative, projectional and generalized inverse methods, etc.). But then it is the history articulated and coauthored by a pioneering contributor to regularization methods. It is also the first book in English which is fully devoted to ill-posed problems in the framework of operator and integral equations. },
